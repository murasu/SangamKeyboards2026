# Connecting External Displays to Android

1. Samsung DeX mode on tablets is a feature that turns your tablet into a desktop-like environment, allowing for better multitasking with a PC-like interface

2. Connect android to external display devices via DisplayLink adapters. The DisplayLink Presenter app is used to mirror your phone's screen to the external monitor. 
	- Mirroring, not Extending: Like the wireless method, this is screen mirroring (duplication), not an extended desktop display.
	- Control over Aspect Ratio: The advantage of using a DisplayLink adapter with the DisplayLink Presenter app is that the app gives you more control. Some users have found that they can force a 16:9 aspect ratio or other adjustments to make the image fit the external monitor better, though this may cause some apps to restart.
	- Third-party Apps: You may find some third-party Android apps designed to manage display resolutions and aspect ratios, though this is not a standard, built-in Android feature.
